Hello,

This is the future home of a system that can retrieve the true
property tax that you should pay given the infrastructure.
The hope of this program will be to increase road funding,
school funding, and other service funding.

This project works by comparing the number of houses on a
street, this also includes the schools. But the main focus is
on the infrastructure that services the building, such as
water mains.

This system further though takes major roadways like a 8 lane
super highways, and applies the damage to the immediate
vacinity, but in a methodological way. For each mile an hour
average (calculated by current speed limits), add half a mile
to the total diameter and distribute the cost of this roadway
amongst all of the people with a radial distance of of half
the speed limit.

This half metric comes from the fact that the average commute time is 26.6 minutes, which is about half an hour. And you can travel half the number of miles of the speed limit within half an hour.

How to calculate the real cost of your property tax that is able to support the services on a property.
